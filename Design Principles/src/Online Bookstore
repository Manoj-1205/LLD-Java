Problem: Design a system for an online bookstore that sells various books to customers. The system should handle
inventory management, customer orders, and provide search functionality for customers to find books.

Requirements:

1. Customers should be able to browse books by title, author, genre, and other criteria.
2. The system should maintain an inventory of books with information such as title, author, price, and availability.
3. Customers should be able to add books to their cart and place orders.
4. The system should track customer orders and provide order history.
5. The system should handle multiple customers simultaneously and ensure data consistency.

Your task:
Design a system for the online bookstore that adheres to SOLID principles and promotes code reusability, maintainability,
 and extensibility. Consider how to organize the classes, define their responsibilities, and handle interactions between
  different components.

You can start by outlining the high-level classes and their relationships, identifying potential abstractions or
interfaces, and considering how to handle various operations such as book search, inventory management, and order processing.
 You may also think about how to incorporate other SOLID principles like the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
 and the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) to make the system modular and easily extendable.

Once you've designed the system, you can provide an overview of the classes, their responsibilities,
and how they interact with each other to fulfill the requirements of the online bookstore.
